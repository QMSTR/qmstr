## About Quartermaster

Quartermaster is an integrated Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
toolchain that implements industry best practises of license
compliance management.

Quartermaster runs adjacent to a software build in CI or development
environments. It collects build graphs, performs analysis and
generates compliance reports (for developers, reviewers, upstream and
downstream).

Quartermaster focuses on fact finding and accurate, complete and
up-to-date compliance documentation.

Quartermaster is developed under an openly governed collaborative
model. For more information, visit [the Quartermaster
website](http://qmstr.org), or follow the
[@fosscompliance](https://twitter.com/fosscompliance) Twitter account.
