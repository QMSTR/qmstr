A key impulse for the development of QMSTR was the realization that
there is still no industry standard for FOSS compliance tooling, and
the understanding that the management of software copyright and
license compliance in FOSS needs to improve. While from a legal
perspective, every obligation and liability technically boils down to
managing the risk of running into trouble and the mitigation of
possible damage, we believe that this is not the right mindset to
approach FOSS license compliance.

## FOSS compliance as a hygiene factor

Instead, we suggest to view FOSS license compliance as a hygiene
factor. [Hygiene factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory) "do
not give positive satisfaction or lead to higher motivation, though
dissatisfaction results from their absence." In the context of FOSS,
this means that members of the wider open source community -- users,
downstream communities, businesses and others -- expect all other
community members to deliver their best effort to fulfill all their
obligations from consuming and distributing FOSS. The wider open
source community forms a society, and being a member of good standing
in that society requires actively supporting the norms of the
community. In this thought-model, neglecting FOSS compliance amounts
to anti-social behavior.

This approach may sound a bit theoretical, but it has real-life
implications. Contributors prefer to be part of companies that hold up
community standards. Shirking obligations or free-riding may deter
potential customers and suppliers. Litigation is costly and
unpleasant. But the most important aspect is that uncertainty about
compliance and litigation undermines the motivation to collaborate
within the global upstream/downstream network that is the fabric of
Open Source.

## Creating an industry standard for FOSS compliance documentation

The QMSTR community aims at creating industry standard tooling for
compliance by being truly open from two perspectives: All of the
project's source code is open and the project is openly
governed. Every interested stakeholder is invited to contribute and to
participate in roadmap setting and requirements development. This
approach reduces barriers to the adoption of FOSS compliance solutions
across the industry and supports the emergence of an industry standard
for FOSS license compliance management.

## Contributors and project history

QMSTR is a FOSS project both by licensing and by governance. It
originated from a brainstorm session of
the [FSFE Legal Network](https://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/ln.en.html)
in April 2017 on what tooling functionality is needed to streamline
the maintenance of FOSS license compliance across international supply
chains. A first proof of concept was developed summer and fall 2017
and demonstrated to interested parties. After the proof of concept was
found to be viable, product development started in January 2018 with
the support of Google and Siemens. The first 0.1 release was made in
April 2018.

The QMSTR development team is initially hosted
by [Endocode](https://endocode.com). With the launch of
the
[Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org) [Automated Compliance Tooling (ACT)](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2018/12/the-linux-foundation-to-launch-new-tooling-project-to-improve-open-source-compliance/) project,
QMSTR will incubate there together with other FOSS compliance
like [Fossology](https://www.fossology.org/). Since summer 2018,
Endocode is part of the [FASTEN](https://www.fasten-project.eu/)
consortium that got funded for three years by the European Commission
H2020 program. FASTEN stands for "fine-grained analysis of software
ecosystems as networks". The consortium develops FOSS tooling that
delivers dependency information to developer's finger tips. QMSTR will
continue to be developed as part of the project and provide the FOSS
compliance related functionality as well as the client side command
line integration of the FASTEN functionality.
