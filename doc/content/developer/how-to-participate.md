The QMSTR development process is open to everybody to participate and
contribute. The QMSTR community aims at a maximum of openness,
transparency and accountability, and at minimizing barriers for
newcomers. There are three pillars to the work of the community:

* *An open development process*: Development is organized into
  quarterly milestones made up of bi-weekly sprints. Requirements are
  collaboratively developed. The QMSTR community offers mentoring
  opoprtunities. All parts of QMSTR are free and open source software.
* *Open governance*: QMSTR is hosted at the Linux Foundation ACT
  project, providing a neutral, non-discriminating collaboration
  platform.
* *An open funding process*: The QMSTR community transparently
  separates between collaborative development and adjacent business
  interests. Commercial participation is encouraged, provided that
  there is clarity of stakeholder goals and a commitment to developing
  all parts of the compliance toolchain under a free and open source
  license.

## An open development process

QMSTR development is organized around quarterly milestones made up of
five to six bi-weekly sprints. Every milestone begins with a
requirements development workshop and ends with a release. There are
three milestone releases each year, as the community takes a summer
break. The
[QMSTR community collaborates on GitHub](https://github.com/QMSTR)
using the usual pull request based development model.

Each milestone period opens with a public requirements workshop that
usually lasts one day. These workshops are commonly organized at the
Endocode office in Berlin or co-located with major open source
conferences. The key goals for every milestone release are developed
at these workshops. The workshops are also an opportunity to provde
feedback from production deployments, which helps to develop the
concepts for larger scale or conceptual
changes. [Subscribe to the QMSTR newsletter](https://qmstr.org/contact/) or

The QMSTR community offers mentoring for both development and
operations newcomers. Mentorships are coordinated using
the [CommunityBridge platform](https://communitybridge.org/) provided
by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

All code that the QMSTR community develops is released as free and
open source software. While third parties are encouraged to develop
modules and extensions for QMSTR under various business models, the
toolchain developed by the QMSTR community and the data modeled in the
QMSTR knowledge graph are always released under free licenses. This
approach supports the goal of creating an industry standard for open
source compliance tooling. It also contrasts with commercial products
that may release some code as open source, but accumulate appropriated
open source compliance information and sell it back to the wider open
source community.

## Open governance

With the launch of
the
[Automation in Compliance Tooling (ACT)](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2018/12/the-linux-foundation-to-launch-new-tooling-project-to-improve-open-source-compliance/) project,
QMSTR will incubate under this neutral umbrella. Besides contributing
to QMSTR as a developer, ACT offers opportunities for other
stakeholders to engage with the project, participate in the steering
committees and coordinate development jointly with other compliance
tooling related projects.

## An open funding process

Many businesses need open source compliance tooling and are willing to
contribute to its development either with code or with funding. The
recommended way to support QMSTR with funding is to join the Linux
Foundation ACT project.

Multiple parties support or have supported the development of QMSTR,
including Siemens and Google. Major support for the project is
provided by the European Commission in the form of a grant to
the [FASTEN Project](https://www.fasten-project.eu/).

Stakeholders interested in funding QMSTR are requested to clearly
separate their business interest from the development of the open
source compliance toolchain, to commit to all of the QMSTR toolchain
being open source, and to be transparent about their business goals. The
QMSTR community supports this by delineating the open source compliance
toolchain from complementary product or service offerings.
