# Quartermaster - Documentation

Quartermaster focuses on generating license and compliance information
for a concrete software project package that is being packaged for use
or distribution. It tracks what source files and external dependencies
get pulled into the created package during the build and then combines
this information with the results of tools that identify licensing and
copyright information for those artifacts.
