# Quartermaster - Documentation

Quartermaster is an integrated free and open source software (FOSS)
toolchain that implements industry best practises of license
compliance management.

Quartermaster runs adjacent to a software build in continuous
integration or development environments. It collects build graphs,
performs analysis and generates compliance reports that are can be
targeted to developers, compliance reviewers or up- and downstream
users.

Quartermaster focuses on fact finding and accurate, complete and
up-to-date compliance documentation by generating documentation for
specific to a package intended for distribution. Software revisions,
build configuration changes or differing methods of packaging may
change the inbound licenses for a package, which is why QMSTR combines
build graph information with static code analysis.

Quartermaster itself is FOSS and developed under a collaborative model.
